The matrix we work with is:
      6.13       -2.9       5.86 
      8.08      -6.31      -3.89 
     -4.36          1       0.19 

Our b vector:
      6.23 
      5.37 
      2.29 

From gsl_linalg_HH_solve we get x to:
   -1.1379 
  -2.83303 
  0.851459 

We check that A*x=b by using gsl_blas_dgemv on A and x
      6.23 
      5.37 
      2.29 

We see we get the wanted result since A*x=b
