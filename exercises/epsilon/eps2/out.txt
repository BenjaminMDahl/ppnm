sum up float=15.4037
sum down float=18.8079

 The difference comes from starting by summing small numbers up to big numbers lets the small numbers contribute where the other way around cuts off the small numbers in the end do to how float makes approximations of numbers
the sum should not converges since it is the harmonic series however do to how floats a approximated i think it does here

double sum up=20.9662
double sum down=18.8079
Again we shold get the same result, but do to round of errors we don't
